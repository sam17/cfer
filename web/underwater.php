    The objective of this project is to facilitate a continuing learning and development
    autonomous systems in underwater robotics. Currently, an autonomous underwater
    vehicle (AUV) is being considered in this project. A robotic system working underwater,
    in an autonomous mode, is a huge challenge both from the design and the implementation
    points of view. Students at IIT Kharagpur are being encouraged to take up this
    project at various levels and develop innovative solutions. The Research on AUV
    will focus on various aspects of engineering and science through multi-functional,
    cross disciplinary groups including innovative mechanical design, control systems,
    machine vision, precise navigation, advanced AI techniques and development of
    related indigenous technology.

    <b>Several interesting outcomes</b> are expected from this
    project, namely, a vision guided and controlled AUV, Navigation system based on
    acoustic array, Swarm robotics for AUVs using acoustic
    communication, Development of accurate underwater simulator for robotics
    application, 3-dimensional simultaneous localization and mapping (3D-SLAM) of
    using sonar and vision.
